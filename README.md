# Algorithm_Simulator
A school project

### Features
1. Simulate the procedure of 4 difference sorting algorithms with a visual bar chart
2. Display the code procedure step by step, so that people could easily understand which piece once is exicuting.
3. Full control of sorting procedure. User can "Pause", "Step ahead" and "Step back" to learn the code and algorithm.
