<p>The selection sort is the easiest method of sorting. In this, to sort the d ascending order, the 0th element is compare with all other element. If the 0th element is found to be greater than the compared element then they are interchanged. In this way, after first iteration, the smallest element is placed at 0th position. The procedure is repeated for 1st element and so on.</p>
<p>Analysis:Selecting the smallest element requires scanning all n elements, so this takes n − 1 comparisons and then Swapping or interchanging it into the first position. Finding the next lowest element requires scanning the remaining (n − 1) elements and so on, for
    <br/>(n − 1) + (n − 2) + ... + 2 + 1 = n (n − 1) / 2=O(n2)<br/>
Best Case = O(n2)<br/>Average Case= O(n2)<br/>Worst Case= O(n2)</p>
