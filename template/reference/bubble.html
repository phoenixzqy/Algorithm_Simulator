<p>The Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting technique, in which smallest data element are moved or „bubbled up‟ to the top. In this method, first element is compared with the next element in the array. If the element is first element is larger, then swap or interchange them and move the smaller element to the top position otherwise no swapping or interchange of element is required. After (N-1) comparisons, the largest element among all the element will descends to the bottom of array.</p>

<p>Analysis: Bubble sort is data sensitive. The number of iterations required may be between 1 and (N-1). The base case for bubble sort is when only one iteration is required. The number of comparisons required is (N-1). The worst case arises when the given array is sorted in reverse order.
<br>Best Case = O (n)
<br>Average Case = O (n2)
<br>Worst Case= O (n2)</p>
